Description: This package performs causal gene fine-mapping for a genomic region
    through integration of colocalization probabilities from colocalization
    analysis and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) scan summary 
    statistics. The probabilistic framework implemented in this package can be 
    used for implication of causal genes as well as estimation of their effect 
    sizes.
